An overview of the files on the /boot/firmware partition (the 1st partition
on the SD card) used by the Ubuntu boot process (roughly in order) is as
follows:

* bootcode.bin   - this is the second stage bootloader loaded by all pis with
                   the exception of the pi4 (where this is replaced by flash
                   memory)
* config.txt     - the configuration file read by the boot process
* start*.elf     - the third stage bootloader, which handles device-tree
                   modification and which loads...
* vmlinuz        - the Linux kernel
* cmdline.txt    - the Linux kernel command line
* initrd.img     - the initramfs
